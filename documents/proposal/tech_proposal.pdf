    Project Title: Advanced AI-Powered Proposal Evaluation System
    
    Executive Summary:
    This project aims to develop an innovative AI-powered system for automated proposal evaluation. 
    The system will leverage natural language processing and machine learning to assess technical 
    merit, commercial potential, and compliance of SBIR/STTR proposals.
    
    Technical Approach:
    Our approach combines state-of-the-art transformer models with domain-specific knowledge 
    extraction techniques. The system will analyze proposal text for technical feasibility, 
    innovation level, and implementation methodology.
    
    Innovation:
    The key innovation lies in our multi-modal evaluation framework that considers both 
    technical content and commercial viability. We employ advanced NLP techniques including 
    BERT-based classification and semantic similarity analysis.
    
    Risk Assessment:
    Primary risks include data quality issues and model interpretability. We mitigate these 
    through robust data preprocessing and explainable AI techniques.
    
    Implementation Plan:
    Phase I will focus on prototype development and validation. Phase II will involve 
    full-scale deployment and commercialization.
    
    Team Qualifications:
    Our team includes experts in AI/ML, proposal evaluation, and SBIR/STTR processes. 
    The PI has 15+ years of experience in machine learning and natural language processing.

    COMMERCIAL PROPOSAL
    
    Market Analysis:
    The proposal evaluation market is valued at $2.5 billion annually, with significant 
    growth potential in government contracting. Current manual evaluation processes are 
    time-consuming and expensive.
    
    Customer Base:
    Primary customers include government agencies, research institutions, and private 
    companies that regularly evaluate proposals. The SBIR/STTR program alone processes 
    thousands of proposals annually.
    
    Value Proposition:
    Our system reduces evaluation time by 80% while improving consistency and accuracy. 
    This translates to significant cost savings and better decision-making.
    
    Competitive Analysis:
    Current solutions are limited to basic text analysis. Our AI-powered approach provides 
    deeper insights and more accurate assessments than existing tools.
    
    Commercialization Strategy:
    We will initially target SBIR/STTR programs, then expand to other government and 
    private sector markets. Revenue model includes licensing fees and subscription services.
    
    Transition Plan:
    Phase III will focus on commercialization through partnerships with government 
    contractors and direct sales to agencies.

#### Subtopic I02.01: Multidisciplinary Space Hardware design automation leveraging AI techniques

NASA’s [Text-to-Spaceship Vision](https://www.nasa.gov/text-to-spaceship/) has shown that AI-powered design workflows can cut hardware iteration cycles from weeks to hours and unlock novel high-performance designs that enable new science missions. NASA now seeks innovative solutions that extend this AI-powered design automation paradigm to every discipline needed for mission design: thermal, power, mechanisms, avionics, propulsion, attitude control, cryogenic systems, and more. Proposed efforts should deliver design automation tools or frameworks that accelerate hardware design, analysis, and verification while keeping human engineers in the loop for expert design validation.

Proposers should create an AI-based design automation tool that ingests requirements (natural language, MBSE artifacts, or standard digital files such as STEP), creates a design, runs embedded analyses, and returns a verification report, all via open, documented APIs for compatibility with the broader *Text-to-Spaceship* workflow. Solutions must focus on hardware design acceleration and, in Phase I, demonstrate the capability on at least one subsystem or component.

**Preference will be given to proposals that:**

- **Demonstrate** an end-to-end automated design loop completed at least 5× faster than current practice for the chosen subsystem.  
- **Provide** embedded physics-based or surrogate analyses with pass/fail metrics traceable to input requirements.  
- **Deliver** real-time manufacturability feedback (CNC, additive manufacturing, PCB, composites, etc.) via open standards such as STEP/STEP-NC, IPC-2581, FMI, or REST/JSON.  
- **Offer** an agentic or plug-in architecture that can add skills for additional subsystems in Phase II.

Successful concepts will accelerate NASA flight-hardware development, reduce cost and risk, and **spawn commercial tools that accelerate any physical product design** such as Text-to-House, Text-to-Vehicle, and beyond.

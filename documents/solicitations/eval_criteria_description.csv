Commercial,INTRODUCTION,5,INTRODUCTION,"Write a clear, concise description of what your business does, your technology solution and advantage, where you are in your business evolution, and how SBIR Ignite fits into your firm's future. Readers should understand the purpose and value of the proposed technology."
Commercial,PRODUCT / SOLUTION,15,TECHNOLOGY VALIDATION,"Describe the evidence you have that validates your solution(s) work from a technical point of view. The ""gold standard"" here is commercial product sales with happy customers."
Commercial,PRODUCT / SOLUTION,15,"COMPETITION, SUBSTITUTES & DIFFERENTIATION","Compared with existing and emerging solutions, describe your value differentiation. Why do you believe customers will choose your solution? The best competitive analyses thoroughly account for substitute technologies -- which might solve the same problem in a very different way -- as well as direct competition."
Commercial,PRODUCT / SOLUTION,15,TECHNICAL RISKS AND MITIGATION PLANS,"A key historical difference between success and failure in NASA's SBIR program is offerors' understanding of the unknowns and challenges they are likely to face in maturing their technologies. Prove to the reader that your team is sophisticated and clear-eyed in analyzing the remaining risks your technology faces. Demonstrate that you have plans to mitigate those risks. In this section, your risk narrative (to include mitigation plans) should be focused on technical matters. Please point out which risk mitigation plans would take place during a Phase I effort, during a Phase II effort and which would be post-Phase II."
Commercial,PRODUCT / SOLUTION,15,INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY,"Describe the critical intellectual property (IP) in your solution (patents, trade secrets, copyrights.) How do you (or will you) protect this IP? Why will this IP be a durable advantage in light of other means of solving the same problem?"
Commercial,NON-NASA MARKET KNOWLEDGE,25,CUSTOMER ENGAGEMENT,"Describe your relationships with non-NASA early-adopters who either (1) are doing business with you, or (2) will be doing business with you soon. Demonstrate you are building valuable customer relationships."
Commercial,NON-NASA MARKET KNOWLEDGE,25,MARKET SEGMENTATION,Use an identified pain point to segment your market; these potential customers all have the same financially relevant problem. Succinctly describe the market segment you are targeting outside of NASA. What sets this segment apart from others?
Commercial,NON-NASA MARKET KNOWLEDGE,25,MARKET SIZING ANALYSIS,"Describe how large your market is. How credible is your knowledge? This is designed to assess the quality of your analysis, not the relative size of the market."
Commercial,NON-NASA MARKET KNOWLEDGE,25,MARKET TIMING,Why is now the time to scale a company in your non-NASA market segment? Support your assertions by describing how current and emerging trends are converging to create your opportunity. How well do you understand those trends?
Commercial,BUSINESS MODEL,25,PRICING,"Describe your pricing model. What will you charge? To what evidence can you point that customers will find your pricing attractive? What are your resulting gross margin(s), and how will those margins eventually support organic growth for your firm (i.e. growth without external investments or grants.)"
Commercial,BUSINESS MODEL,25,SCALABILITY,"Argue your business gets more attractive as it grows. What's required to reach economies of scale (and, if appropriate, economies of scope)?"
Commercial,BUSINESS MODEL,25,FUNDING STRATEGY,"NASA Ignite aims to be the last SBIR funding for the firms it funds. Share your plans for funding to scale beyond SBIR funding. To the extent that raising risk capital (VC, angel, venture debt) is part of your plan, point to your best evidence that you'll successfully raise these funds. How would Ignite funding change your firm's capitalization trajectory?"
Commercial,TEAM,25,BUSINESS QUALIFICATIONS & EXPERIENCE,"Briefly list and describe your business team. Please describe their qualifications and experience as it relates to successfully running commercial businesses. (Note: this is intentionally distinct from the ""Technical Qualifications & Experience"" metric below.)"
Commercial,TEAM,25,TECHNICAL QUALIFICATIONS & EXPERIENCE,Briefly list and describe your core scientific and technical team with an emphasis on their past accomplishments and experiences. Why are these the right technologists for this particular NASA subtopic?
Commercial,TEAM,25,GAPS IN TEAM,"Do you have the key people you need to get to through an eventual Phase II NASA effort? If not, convince the reader you have a credible recruiting plan and can fill personnel gaps."
Commercial,PRESENTATION QUALITY,5,QUALITY OF PROSE,"Provide a clear, well written, and convincing proposal. Avoid jargon and define technical terms."
Commercial,PRESENTATION QUALITY,5,DATA QUALITY & ATTRIBUTION,"Support your arguments with relevant, properly attributed data to enhance your credibility."
Technical,BENEFITS,30,TECHNOLOGY DESCRIPTION,Describe your technology and how it addresses this NASA subtopic's need. What is it? What are its benefits? What makes it unique?
Technical,BENEFITS,30,ALIGNMENT,Argue your technology innovation is aligned with this NASA SBIR subtopic's priorities as defined in the solicitation.
Technical,BENEFITS,30,IMPACT,"If successful, describe your technology's expected impact on the described subtopic need."
Technical,ADVANCING THE STATE OF THE ART,10,ADVANCING THE STATE OF THE ART,Describe how your technology would improve the state of the art -- as described in the subtopic solicitation.
Technical,TECHNICAL RISK,20,TECHNICAL FEASIBILITY,Convince readers that your technology is built atop sound scientific and/or engineering principles.
Technical,TECHNICAL RISK,20,TECHNICAL RISKS AND MITIGATION PLANS,"A key historical difference between success and failure in NASA's SBIR program is offerors' understanding of the unknowns and challenges they are likely to face in maturing their technologies. Prove to the reader that your team is sophisticated and clear-eyed in analyzing the remaining risks your technology faces. Demonstrate that you have plans to mitigate those risks. In this section, your risk narrative (to include mitigation plans) should be focused on technical matters. Please point out which risk mitigation plans would take place during a Phase I effort, during a Phase II effort and which would be post-Phase II."
Technical,TECHNICAL RISK,20,DATA QUALITY,Do your best to prove your technical claims with quality data attributed to credible sources (including relevant academic research.) These data should logically support your technical feasibility arguments and risk narrative.
Technical,SBIR PROJECT PLAN,15,"TIMELINES, MILESTONES, DELIVERABLES","Please share your execution plan with timeline, milestones and proposed deliverables."

Technical,TEAM ABILITY,20,TECHNICAL FACILITIES & RESOURCES,"Briefly list and describe your technical facilities and resources. Do you have the resources and technical facilities you need to successfully complete your proposed project through a Phase II and beyond? If not, convince the reader you have a credible plan to attain the necessary facilities or resources to accomplish the proposed solution."

Technical,TEAM ABILITY,20,PARTNERSHIPS / SUBCONTRACTS,"Describe any organizations with which you plan to partner as you mature the proposed technology. Emphasize any partnerships relevant through a Phase II award -- this is our main focus. Later partnerships (and plans) should be mentioned. Summarize the nature and timing of these partnerships. If partnering is not required to successfully mature your technology, please explain why."
